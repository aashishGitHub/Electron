# Electron
My experiments with Electron, Electron-Winstaller and Electron-Squirrel to create a desktop application.

Navigate to Electron/icp-demo/myapp-source-built-installers/Setup.exe
Install in windows PC
Run it to open the desktop application hosting the web content.

Check the installed software in control panel.
